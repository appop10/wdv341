    <ol>
        <li><strong>Version Control Software: </strong>a system that keeps track of the changes made to code that you've stored on it. It's very helpful if you need to revisit older versions of code to fix bugs, and it allows you to also collaborate with other developers in real time. </li>

        <li><strong>Add: </strong>moves the chosen files to the staging area. In other words, it tells the software which file you want in the next commit, meaning you need to git add before you commit.</li>

        <li><strong>Commit: </strong>when you make a change to the file, you can commit it and it'll save your work at that point in time along with information such as who made what changes and when those changes were made.</li>

        <li><strong>Push: </strong>when you make changes in your local repository, you need to push them to the repository online before anyone can see and/or edit your work.</li>

        <li><strong>Pull: </strong>when someone has made changes to the repository online, you need to pull those changes into your local repository to work on them in a local environment.</li>

        <li><strong>Clone: </strong>the local copy of your repository. It allows you to work offline, and both are still connected so you can push changes to the one on the online server. It is also the act of making that copy of a repository.</li>
